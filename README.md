# Implementation of Engquist-Majda absorbing boundary conditions for 2D Wave Eq.
Matlab code of the finite difference method for 2D wave equation.

The left wall is imposed with the Engquist-Majda absorbing boundary condition from the article "*Engquist, B., & Majda, A. (1977). Absorbing boundary conditions for numerical simulation of waves. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 74(5), 1765-1766.*". Neumann boundary conditions are imposed on the other walls (as in the article).

Feel free to use and contribute.
